# 🙋 About Me
I am a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Engineering](https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), [Churchill College](https://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by [Dr.Stephan Goetz](https://stephanmgoetz.github.io/). My research is about the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in the patent domain, including patent analysis and patent text generation. If you are interested in related topics, please feel free to contact me! 

Prior to this, I obtained my master degree in [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) at University of Cambridge. My thesis was focused on language models and federated learning, supervised by [Dr.Nic Lane](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/ndl32). I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/).

# ⭐ Research Interests
- *General LLMs*: Investigating the fundamental capabilities, limitations, and optimization of LLMs, such as fine-tuning and evaluation methods.

- *LLM Agents*: Developing LLM-based agents for decision-making, reasoning, and task-specific adaptations in diverse domains.

- *LLMs for Patents*: Applying LLMs to solve patent-specific challenges, such as patent generation and analysis, to support intellectual property professionals.

I am open to collaborations in all related areas. I am also willing to help if you are undergraduate students interested in learning how to conduct research with LLMs or planning to apply to Cambridge.
